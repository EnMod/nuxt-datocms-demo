#  Nuxt/DatoCMS Static SPA Demo

This project serves as an example of how to implement DatoCMS in a `nuxt generate`'d SPA at build time, as well as a Nuxt.js refactor of [this site](https://teach.mccc.edu) with quite a lot of simplifications.  **It's worth noting that this refactor is not exact.**

Uses data from [generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com),  filler text from [Honest Ipsum](http://johnclendvoy.ca/honestipsum), and incredibly cute placeholder images from [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com).
